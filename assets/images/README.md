### Main Images

- **Hero Image**: High-quality photo of barbershop interior or barber at work
- **Aaron's Photo**: Professional headshot or action shot of Aaron cutting hair
- **Open Graph Image**: Social media preview image (1200x630px)

### Optimization Tips
1. Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images
2. Provide alt text for all images (already implemented in HTML)
3. Consider WebP format for better compression
4. Use responsive images for different screen sizes

## Image Placeholder Service

While you gather real images, you can use placeholder services:
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/barbershop
- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/barber/
- **Placeholder.com**: https://placeholder.com/

## SEO Considerations

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "classic-fade-haircut.jpg" instead of "IMG_001.jpg")
- Include relevant keywords in alt text
- Ensure images are properly sized for their containers
- Use structured data for gallery images (already implemented)

## File Naming Convention

Use lowercase letters, hyphens for spaces, and descriptive names:
- ✅ `classic-fade-haircut.jpg`
- ✅ `aaron-cutting-hair.jpg`
- ✅ `barbershop-interior.jpg`
- ❌ `IMG_001.jpg`
- ❌ `Photo 1.JPG`
- ❌ `image1.png`
